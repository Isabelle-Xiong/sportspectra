# Sportspectra

Connect sports fans and athletes globally through live streaming, coaching, and community.

## Background

As an avid table tennis player who has represented Canada at national levels, I've long sought ways to better connect communities around niche sports without varsity programs or large mainstream followings. Many sports like table tennis offer passionate fanbases but limited opportunities for competitive play, international matches, or virtual engagement between athletes and fans globally. Since the pandemic underscored our need for virtual connections within smaller sporting circles, I decided to build Sportspectra - a platform focusing on live streaming, coaching and community for niche sports without varsity teams but dedicated worldwide fanbases. My goal is to foster vibrant global communities and interactive experiences for sports that may not receive widespread traditional coverage but have just as devoted athletes and fans.

## Current Features

- Basic live streaming
- Camera Switching
- Mute/ Unmute
- Screen Sharing
- Comment/chat functionality for viewers

## Future Roadmap

- Interactive training and spectating sessions in virtual rooms with pro athletes & coaches
- VR/AR integration for immersive viewing
- Skill challenges and tournaments
- Community forums, networking and event listings  
- Advanced stats, analytics and strategy breakdowns
- Crowdfunding support for up-and-coming amateur athletes
- Global sports marketplace

My vision is for Sportspectra to foster meaningful connections between dedicated fans and athletes. Whether through interactive coaching, immersive viewing, or their favorite online sports communities, I want this platform to help further engage people in niche sports worldwide.
